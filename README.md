# Weekface

Weekface is a simple app that has allowed me to practice various aspects of iOS development. Although its functionality is limited, it has been a valuable learning resource in areas such as:

- **UIKit Constraints**: Despite challenges, I've managed to make the interface display well on any iOS device, although not in landscape format.
- **Animations and Haptic Feedback**: I've experimented with different animations and implemented haptic feedback in the app.
- **Interface Element Customization**: I've created custom components by overriding some system classes to give certain interface elements rounded edges.
- **Touch Interaction**: The central image responds to touches as if it were a button, providing an interactive user experience.

In addition, I've designed the graphics for both the animations and the background. I used simple images for the animations and vector graphics for the background.

## Current Status and Future Improvements

The Weekface app is already available in my GitHub portfolio. However, I still need to refactor the code and make it work in landscape mode.
